**LifeGPA**

This is a project for build week at Lambda School. 

My contribution is a landing page and a "About Us" page. The landing page also has links to a page I made about goal ideas.

The pages are responsive for desktop (1000px +), tablet (800px +) and mobile (500px -) styles. The styles are written with LESS, using variables, mixins, and nesting. They use animations and keyframe animations for subtle styling of links and buttons.

**Pitch**

If you gave your life a grade right now what would it be?

How would you rank your combined efforts in all your different life categories like personal development, professional goals, physical fitness, AND relationship building?

There are so many productivity and habit tracking apps out there to measure progress in one area or another, but nothing that measures your overall life with a single metric until now. Meet LifeGPA. An app designed to summarize your lifeâ€™s most important efforts into a simple composite number.
MVP
- Users create an account, log in, and tell the app a list of habits they want to track. 
- There are both prompts to add habits to your list, and spots to write your own. 
- The app evaluates the daily habits and rather than calculating streaks on a calendar, it calculates a percentage of times a certain habit has been done int he past 30, 60, or 90 days. 
- Then, it averages out all the habits' averages into one overall average. 
- All you do is tell the app which habits you performed each day.
Stretch
- visualize the data over time on some sort of graph that shows improvement or a decline for the habits the user is choosing
